## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS
Testing out my front-end capabilities, I wanted to create a template landing pad for a kitchen website. 
## Optimizations
If I had more time I'd like to go back and go fix some media query issues. I would change the backgrounds and how the image layout moves when the site is'nt in full screen. And I would create a slider for  image selections that could possibly lead to another page for specfic food items.

## Lessons Learned:
This is one of the first websites I've coded, and I learned a lot for front-end development here. I had to research a lot, and experiented with flex for the first time vs going for floats.
